<p class="deck">You may be asking yourself, do we really need another
front-end framework? And the answer is no, we don't. The reason Fuselage exists
is because I needed another front-end framework &mdash;because the ones I tried
to use there are too heavy, too opinionated, and overwhelming to customize.
This fits my needs, and if no one ever uses it but me, I'd be just fine with
that.</p>

<h3>How's it different?</h3>

<p>Fuselage has no javascript dependencies, compiles on
<a target="_blank" href="http://libsass.org/">Libsass</a>, and handles some
historically problematic elements well. It has
<a href="{{ '/docs/tables' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">responsive tables</a> baked
in, a <a href="{{ '/docs/widths' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">simple and powerful
grid system</a>, and typography based on
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.modularscale.com/">Modular Scale</a>.</p>

<p>It handles <a href="{{ '/docs/forms' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">responsive
forms</a> well, provides some
<a href="{{ '/docs/helpers' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">thoughtful helpers</a>, and
looks pretty darn good too. All with the goal to get you up and running quickly.
Quit rebuilding things over and over, and build websites faster and more
consistently.</p>
